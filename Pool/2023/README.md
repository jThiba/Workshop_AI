# :wave: Welcome to the PoC Artificial Intelligence Pool 2023 !

During one week, you will discover the different facets of artificial intelligence: from data science, to neural networks, through the most used libraries and without forgetting deep learning

At the end of this pool, you will have the keys to start any project involving artificial intelligence.

The pool is divided in 2 parts: a training and an application of knowledge.

The training takes place in 5 days, each day will focus on a theme around the space and will be supervised by students with deep knowledge in these areas.

External speakers will also come to bring their experience in the field and explain the main axes of artificial intelligence in a company and in the research world. They will also give you important advice.

## :open_book: Day 1 - Introduction to AI world

In this first day, we will introduce you to the world of artificial intelligence. We will explain the different facets of this discipline and the different tools that exist.

In this day, we will discover:

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python
- Data Science

[SUBJECT](./day01/)

## :open_book: Day 2 - Maths and Neural Networks

In this second day, we will introduce you to the mathematical concepts that are used in artificial intelligence. We will also discover the neural networks and their functioning.

In this day, we will discover:

- Maths with numpy
- Neuron from scratch

[SUBJECT](./day02/)

## :open_book: Day 3 - What is PyTorch?

In this third day, we will introduce you to the PyTorch library. We will discover the different concepts of this library and how to use it.

In this day, we will discover:

- Neural Networks with PyTorch
- Application of NN with PyTorch
- CNN with PyTorch
- Detection of fractures with PyTorch

[SUBJECT](./day03/)

## :open_book: Day 4 - Auto ML ???? What is it?

In this fourth day, we will introduce you to the Auto ML concept.

In this day, we will discover:

- How to create a model with Auto ML from scratch

[SUBJECT](./day04/)

## :open_book: Day 5 - Universe of Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning

In this fifth day, we will introduce you to the deep learning and reinforcement learning concepts.

In this day, we will discover:

- Reinforcement Learning
- Q-Learning
- Deep Q-Learning with PyTorch

[SUBJECT](./day05/)

## :alarm_clock: Rush

By groups of 3 to 5, you will have to create your own project using the knowledge acquired during the week.
