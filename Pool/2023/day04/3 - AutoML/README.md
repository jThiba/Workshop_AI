# 🚀🔥 AutoML


## 💡 Overview

AutoML is a 🤖 approach to automating the process of building and tuning machine learning models. Its goal is to 💪 reduce the time and effort needed by data scientists and machine learning engineers to create effective models.

### 🤔 What is AutoML?

AutoML (Auto Machine Learning) refers to using algorithms and techniques to automate the building and optimizing of machine learning models. This includes tasks like feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

### 🤷‍♀️ Why AutoML?

AutoML is becoming popular because it makes the process of building machine learning models faster, more efficient, and accessible to a wider range of users, including non-experts. By automating many tedious and time-consuming tasks, AutoML allows data scientists and machine learning engineers to focus on other important aspects of the project.

### 💻 How AutoML works?

AutoML works by using algorithms to search through a vast number of potential model configurations and selecting the best one based on performance metrics and other constraints. This process involves iterating through different combinations of algorithms, hyperparameters, and features and evaluating the performance of each model.

### 💻 How to use AutoML?

To use AutoML, simply provide your data and specify the type of problem you are trying to solve (e.g., classification, regression, etc.). The AutoML tool will then take care of the rest.

## 🔥 Day4

You can choose between 2 different AutoML tools:
- AutoML with H2O
- AutoML with Prophet

### 💪 AutoML with H2O

H2O is an open-source, in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning and predictive analytics platform that allows you to build machine learning models on big data and provides easy productionalization of those models in an enterprise environment.

### 🔥 AutoML with Prophet

Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data with an additive model that includes yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers.

## How to use it?

You have at your disposal two Jupyter Notebooks:
- [One for Time Series Forecasting with Prophet](time_series.ipynb)
- [One for Tabular Data with H2O](tabular.ipynb)

You're tasked with completing both notebooks in order to learn about two different types of AutoML.
